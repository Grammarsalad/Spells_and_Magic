Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d6 Hit Points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +1 weapons to hit. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff also has the power to drain a target of 1d2 Hit Points on every strike. These Hit Points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points beyond <PRO_HISHER> normal maximum.~

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after that; in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 5-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster. For example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 9-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 9-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~

The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames must also make a Save vs. Spell to avoid contracting the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area. This spell is particularly useful in dispersing packs of trolls and frost salamanders.~

Strength reduction is noncumulative, and failing a save while the reduction is in effect will not extend its duration. The caster's weapon proficiency with darts (or lack thereof) has no effect on the darts' chances to hit a target.~

Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage—the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud—if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).~

Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it always leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its Armor Class for 3 rounds.~

The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage, plus an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~

In addition, the target gains +2 to hit, +3 to damage, +2 to Strength, +10 to maximum Hit Points, and +2 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals Hit Points.
