Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell and laying <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a creature, the priest causes 4 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.

Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.

A given creature can only be affected by Cure Minor Wounds once per 8 hours.~
